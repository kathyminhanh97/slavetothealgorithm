I brought to the class my Pseudocode and my refined paper prototype.

## Class Activity 

This week we learned how to turn speech into types. 

This amazed me so much because I didn't think this was possible. The speech recognition was so accurate and had little-to-no delay. It's just like what we normally see on Youtube CC, and it was made in a short amount of time too with just a few lines of codes. 

IT EVEN UNDERSTANDS VIETNAMESE? WHAT THE HELL?

I talked to Yasmin and Jinni for the first time on Zoom . They were so far ahead of me T.T. They showed me different workable links of other people's projects that are about emotion detection using p5js. 

This week I need to figure out a way to track facial expressions to using p5js

**Tutorial that work**

--> Face tracking + emotion detecting using dots

v) https://editor.p5js.org/sl7211/sketches/ry8Q4eqCX

--> Face tracking using clmtrackr + model pca

v) http://www.digipool.info/m/index.php/FaceTracking_with_clmtrackr_and_P5JS

**Although I don't get this to work, I really appreciate Jeff Thompson for posting the video. I tried to do it myself before watching the video and it was like piecing puzzles together without knowing the entire picture. I understand much better now about how this whole thing works**

X) The Emotion detection using Face API using Tenor Flow??? (I need to ask Yasmin again about this)

**QUESTIONS**

1/ Canvas + size

createCanvas(windowWidth,windowHeight); 

 WHY: only see partial of the webcam
 
+ web.hide(); 

WHY: need to roll down ???

The face tracking is not working when I change the size or move it to the centre

2/ Fixing mirroring of webcam: 

translate (width,0);

scale (-1.1);

(?) canâ€™t flip

3) How to Download Tenor Flow?  What is pip?  So we download Anaconda or Python? What is Python virtual environment?

4) How to create a .vert and .frag files on the sketch folder?
