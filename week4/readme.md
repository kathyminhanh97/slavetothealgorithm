## Class Activity 

We learned lots of cool things today using Processing.

In the 1st sketch (or the 1st tutorial), we learned how to use "random", frameRate and how to upload image into the folder. It was challenging keeping up with the fast pace of the class, however, everything turned out amazing. I turned the photo of the non-human machine I made last week into a look-alike pencil sketch, using "stroke" and "stroke weight". Then I learned how to twist it a bit to turn it into a painting which is made of little random dots, using "ellipse".

In the 2nd tutorial, we learned how upload font and make a spining text wheel. I chose "didiot" and played around with different words and colours.
