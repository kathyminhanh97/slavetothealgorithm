# Week4 PITCH IS NEXT WEEK???

## Preparation for next week presentation 

Human brain has always been a exciting topic to me.  

My first thought is having a technology that improves one of my biggest weaknesses which is MEMORY. I forget things very easily, and no matter how hard I try, my childhood memories are starting to fade. 

I know that we human tend to remember things longer when they are attached to our emotions. Therefore, I initially want to create a emotion detect machine, which records my daily emotions and kepts in a smart emotional diary. Each day is illustrated in a different colour which represents the overall emotion of that day, so when I look back at the whole year I can see the colour pattern of that entire year. Moreover, since I am able to play back the emotion of that day, my memories of that particular day will come back.

Another idea is recording emotions of museum visitors when they look at artworks in art museum to create emotional patterns using different colours. These patterns can be printed in souvenir like postcard, t-shirt, etc. so when the visitors look back, they hopefully could remember what they saw in the museum. 

I like these ideas so I start to find information about Emotions and Memories

I end up not go on with the "Memory" path for my pitch because:

1) I want to focus more on the emotion part and I don't want to go down the rabit hole of both emotions and memories. I feel like emotion detecting is the future.

2) Instead, with the growth of Smart House (Almost all of my friend have some sort of smart things in their house: Smart TV, Smart Lighting, SmartHome, etc.), I can see how the surrounding technology is starting to impact our emotions. I believe this topic is worth talking about. 

Althought it isn't on my choice, researching these topic properly expanded my knowledge about how our memories and emotions work. 


## Class Activity 

We learned lots of cool things today using Processing.

In the 1st sketch (or the 1st tutorial), we learned how to use "random", frameRate and how to upload image into the folder. It was challenging keeping up with the fast pace of the class, however, everything turned out amazing. I turned the photo of the non-human machine I made last week into a look-alike pencil sketch, using "stroke" and "stroke weight". Then I learned how to twist it a bit to turn it into a painting which is made of little random dots, using "ellipse".

In the 2nd tutorial, we learned how upload font and make a spining text wheel. I chose "didiot" and played around with different words and colours.
