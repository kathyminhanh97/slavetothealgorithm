# Week4 PITCH IS NEXT WEEK???? WHAT???

## Preparation for next week presentation 

Initually, I wanted to so I gather so many information about this 

**EMOTIONS & EMOTIONS TECHNOLOGY**

--> [Article: Emotion and Our Senses](https://sites.tufts.edu/emotiononthebrain/2014/10/09/emotion-and-our-senses/)


I ended up didn't go on with this path for my pitch because:

1) I don't want to go down the rabit hole of both emotions and memories since I feel like emotion detecting is the future.

2) Instead, combining with the growth of Smart House (Almost all of my friend have some sort of smart things in their house: Smart TV, Smart Lighting, SmartHome, etc.), I believe this topic is worth talking about. 

However, below are interest links I found. Althought I ended up didn't explore on my choice, researching that topic properly expanded my knowledge about how our memories and emotions work.

## Class Activity 

We learned lots of cool things today using Processing.

In the 1st sketch (or the 1st tutorial), we learned how to use "random", frameRate and how to upload image into the folder. It was challenging keeping up with the fast pace of the class, however, everything turned out amazing. I turned the photo of the non-human machine I made last week into a look-alike pencil sketch, using "stroke" and "stroke weight". Then I learned how to twist it a bit to turn it into a painting which is made of little random dots, using "ellipse".

In the 2nd tutorial, we learned how upload font and make a spining text wheel. I chose "didiot" and played around with different words and colours.
