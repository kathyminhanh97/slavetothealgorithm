# Week2 IRL:Analogue Human-Machine systems  
# || Processing part 2
## 12-hour Challenge: 

**I make a system to draw on paper, using different tools and colours**

These tools includes: Oil Pastels 01, Glitter Pen 02, Markers 03, Coloured Pencils 04, Highlighter 05, Finger 06

Colours might vary depends on each tool. 

__*For example:*__ 

*Oil Pastel catergory has Pink-01/ Green-02/ Brown-03/ Yellow-04/ Blue-05/ Orange-06*

*Glitter Pen category has Orange-01/ Purple-02/ Grey-03/ Black-04/ Blue-05/ Green-06*

1. I started by rolling the dice ONCE to know the starting point 
(specific area of the paper represent a different number from 01-06)

1. Then I roll the dice to determine the direction: Right-01/ Left-02/ Up-03/ Up-Right45Degrees-04/ Up-Left45Degrees-05/ Down-06

1. I roll the dice to choose a tool

1. I roll the dice to choose a color

1. I flip a coin to know what style of drawing: ZicZac-Number Side-01/ Circle-Image Side-02

1. I roll the dice to know how many times I have to draw: 15 times-01/ 4 times-02/ 8 times-03/  11 times-04/ 3 times-05/ 7 times-06

**WHAT I DID LEARN/ NOTICE?**

1. I didn't set rules before starting. The rules should have helped guide me when the drawing got to the edge.

1. I notice the sizes of my circle and ziczac is not consistent, some are big, some are very small

=> so with this same system, 2 people will have different outcomes

1. I notice it's very interesting that: 

   1. In step 2, funny how number 06 (going down) rarely appreared, which caused most of my outcomes got stucked in the top half of the canvas. 
   
   1. In step 6 (number of times I have to repeat the ziczic and circle), the dice kept getting number 03 and 06. Not until the 10th set that I got number 02 in step 6

1. I intended to just make 20 sets of the system, however, since the lines kept overdrawn on each other, I had to keep adding more sets to eventually fill the paper. I ended up with 50 sets to complete the drawing.
