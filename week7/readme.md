# Week 7 
# || Paper Prototype || P5js || Pseudocode 

We started the class with a one-minute presentation where we go through everyone's idea. This is my paper prototype (not really?) for my project. After receiving feedback from Karen, I understand that I need to further refine my prototype to have a clearer picture of my project.

I also found a very fun project that uses facial expression to make music. This might help build and expand my project as I didn't think about/ pay much attention on sound. I had been very concentrating on how the visual graphics going to look like.

## Class Activity 

1) We learned how to write Pseudocode, I was too shy to share my Pseudocode to the class because I don't know if it's correct or not. 


FUNCTION Fried eggs

INPUT oil

WHILE the oil is getting hot

IF wants fried eggs 

do nothing=wait

ELSE IF wants scramble eggs 

beat 2 eggs 

add milk

add salt

add pepper

END IF

WHEN the oil is hot

THEN put the eggs into the pan

END IF

OUTPUT fried eggs

2) We learned how to add random letters to the screen and also make "wigglyLetters". I found it very difficult to understand what's going but I managed to keep the same speed with the class and understood the basic concept of using class in p5js.
