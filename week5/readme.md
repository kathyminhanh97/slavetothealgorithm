It was a long but exciting day. My classmates' ideas are very diversed and interesting, very different from mine. 

## My whole idea is basically a eco-system - a smart house that detects and influences the home owner's emotions 

**The inputs are:**

--- Facial expressions/ Heart beats/ Body heat/ Body movements/ Body pose/ Brain Waves/Brain Pattern/ Physiology/ Voice/ Habit 

**The system require:**

--- Facial Tracking/ Physiological Measure/ Body Monitor/ Body Gesture Recognition/ Brain Stimulation/ Voice Activity Detector

**The outputs are:**

--- Automatic Smart House = Lighting (Artificial/Natural)/ Sound (Music)/ Temperature (Room/Water/Bed)/ Humidity/ Projected Wallpaper/ Alarm Clock/ Scent/ Fridge / Bed/ Door

Although we are allowed to go crazy for this pitch, I realised my idea is quite broad. Seems like I need to narrow down to what I really want to do to actually accomplish to next assignment. (T.T)

My have so many ideas that I want to do but my technical skill is 0...
