# Week1 Introductions and Calibrations 
# || Processing part 1
What are we doing here? To be honest, Slave to the Algorithms was not in my class choices so I don't have any clear expectation for this. We started with the definition of generative and parametric design, which is helpful because I don't know the word generative. When I looked it up in Vietnamese dictionary, seperately, generative means be able to produce or create ( it also state "biology related word"?). A design which can produce? When I searched on Google, all the images are bizarre machines and buildings which are made from holes, weird-looking shapes and structures. 
Everything is confusing, but I'm curious and excited for what's coming. 

## Class group Activity
We were spit into groups and our task was to create a generative design without using codes. Our group had a slow start and was quite confusing so this was what we had:

We didn't manage to do in class so I did this at home
