# Week6 Data-Driven design 
# || Storyboarding & Prototyping || Pseudocode

Karen shared with us so many artists and case studies. 

I screenshot most of them and keep them in my Notion note.

All of them are so impressive, However, one of works that I notice is by Kyle MacDonald and Lauren McCarthy. They created US+ which is "Google Hangout app that analyzes speech and facial expression to improve conversation." I am socially awkward and I feel like this is what I need, a machine that tell me what to do and when to do it to improve my conversations.

Lauren also has many other amazing projects that I can help further explore my posibilities in her website.

## Class Activity 
1) We were split into groups. Each member had an chance to make an prototype of the same vintage game with their gorup members. Everyone turned on their webcame so we could see each other working in front of the screen, which was interesting. The only game I know is Mario so we chose Mario to make an prototype. 

This is what I made.

2) We also learn to insert sound into p5js, and using the sound amplitude to change the parameter of an ellipse.
