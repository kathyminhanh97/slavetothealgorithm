## Class Activity

This week, we spent a whole morning to learn how write a artist statement. The rest of the day, everybody was given a chance to consult with Karen and Andy as well as time to share and update their current work with the classmates. Unfortunately, I had some family business to do, so I basically missed a whole day of work. 

Later that day, I watched the recorded video of the Karen showing the Artist Statement template. I was glad that we had the template because there were lots of other things that we had to talk about, rather than just a brief summary of our project. The template gave us a clear detailed guide for not only this project submission but also for other arts projects that we might have later on.

**THINGS I DIDN'T ACHIEVE**

1) I want to control the Volume of the music by using a Slider. However,  

2) "NEUTRAL" doesn't work. It makes sense since we didn't have this emotion in the first place, I just changed the name of the
